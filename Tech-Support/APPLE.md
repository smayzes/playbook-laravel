### Resetting the PRAM

1. Shut down your machine. Yes, all the way down, not sleep or logging out.
2. Press the power button and then press command-option-p-r. You have to make sure you get those keys pressed before the gray screen comes up or it wonâ€™t work.
3. Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.
4. Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.

### Resetting the SMC

1. Shut down the computer (again, full-on off here)
2. Disconnect the MagSafe plug from the machine
3. Remove the battery
4. Press the power button for 5 seconds and release
5. Put the battery back in and reconnect the MagSafe cord
6. Turn your machine back on with the power button
